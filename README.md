# Fenske Overview
My University Final Year thesis, which is a computer program. It is titled A computer-aided program for estimating theoretical number of stages for mixture using distillation separation technique. The computer program used is Visual Basic dot net (VB.net) and is chosen because of its speed and compatibility on any computer platform. The McCabe-Thiele and Fenske methods are employed in this project. The McCabe-Thiele method shows the graphical relationship between mixtures and by applying Smokers equation to data provided, the number of stages is calculated. Fenske method uses a specialized equation to calculate the minimum number of theoretical number of stages. Algorithms of McCabe-Thiele, Fenske and Smokers equation are translated into VB.net codes. The results obtained when the software was employed showed a deviation of 17.113% in the Fenske method program and 11.030% deviation in McCabe-Thiele program, when compared to manual calculations. The speed, accuracy and ease of usage are strong advantages of this application. It is therefore recommended that more computer software on chemical engineering separation techniques should be design to improve ease of calculation, accuracy and speed with delivery.

I re-wrote it again in C#.NET.

The two programs are found here.
